1. System requirements
======================
Gepard requires the Java Runtime Environment Version 5.0 or higher which is 
available at http://www.java.com/download/


2. Tutorial
===========
This download archive contains a file called "tutorial.html" which is a quick-
start guide for your first steps with the program.


3. Command line tool
====================
Since version 1.20 Gepard contains a comand line functionality. In its current 
version it only supports OFFLINE dotplots which means that you have to online
access to the genomes in the PEDANT database from the command line.

To start the comand line tool of Gepard execute the jar file in this way:
java -cp Gepard-1.40.jar org.gepard.client.cmdline.CommandLine
